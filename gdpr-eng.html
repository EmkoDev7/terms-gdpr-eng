        <li>When necessary to fulfill our legal obligations (e.g., issuing invoices for services provided, maintaining order records...)</li>
        <li>When the processing of your personal data is necessary for the conclusion and fulfillment of a contract (service provision) that you have entered into with us or because you requested an offer from us</li>
        <li>When you have given consent for the processing of your personal data for specific processing purposes, with the right to withdraw consent at any time (e.g., for sending promotional messages for services of other companies providing complementary services - taxi services, restaurants...)</li>
        <li>When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data (e.g., sending SMS or email reminders to reduce the likelihood of absence).</li>

    <h2>How Long We Retain Your Personal Data and What Happens Afterwards</h2>
    <p>We retain basic personal data as long as you have the status of our registered user on our websites.</p>
    <p>We permanently store personal data processed based on your consent or until you withdraw this consent.</p>
    <p>We keep invoice data for 10 years from the issuance date.</p>
    <p>We retain data necessary for the conclusion and fulfillment of contracts between you and us for an additional 5 years from the fulfillment of the contract (service provision).</p>
    <p>After the retention period expires, we effectively delete or anonymize personal data, meaning that we process them in a way that they can no longer be linked to you or attributed to you.</p>

    <h2>Voluntary Provision of Data and Consequences of Non-Provision</h2>
    <p>Providing personal data is voluntary. You are not obligated to provide us with personal data, but if you do not, you may not receive certain services or enter into a contract with us. We will specify which data, if not provided, will have the mentioned consequences.</p>

    <h2>Who Has Access to Your Personal Data</h2>
